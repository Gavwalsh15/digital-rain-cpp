This C++ project aims to imitate the digital rain effect from The Matrix, using the Windows Console API to simulate falling characters. The application generates random raindrops that fall from the top of the terminal, with new characters continuously replacing them. In this project, I focused on implementing modern coding practices and object-oriented design while using a multifile structure to ensure better code organization, readability, and maintainability.
