# Digital Rain

## Introduction 
This C++ project is an application that mimics the iconic Digital Rain effect from The Matrix. Developed in C++, it use various functions from the Windows Console API to handle text rendering and create the dynamic falling drops effect. The project focuses key C++ concepts such as object-oriented design, modern C++ coding styles, and efficient memory management and performance.
## Design & Test
The design of the project revolves around creating a fluid and efficient simulation. Key design elements include:

Object-Oriented Design: Classes are used to define the raindrops and manage their state, such as position and character type, while also maintaining the flow of the digital rain and a Random Number generator class.


## Algorithm

## Problem Solving

## Reflection
