Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project. It was a great challenge while learning C++.

Not everything turned out as expected. I do wish I had done more research between classes to explore more ideas or ways to improve my application further.

I also appreciated the focus on writing high-quality code rather than just pure functionality. Sometimes in college projects, we get so caught up in adding features that when we go back to make changes later, the spaghetti code we created makes it nearly impossible. It also made me more aware of the efficiency of programs, something that seems to be overlooked in the modern era with more powerful computers.

This project has provided me with the C++ basics and the guidance to make somewhat high-quality code or at least the direction to get to that stage.
